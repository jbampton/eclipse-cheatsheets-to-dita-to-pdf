        Before we can produce target solutions, we need need to load some ownship data. We&apos;ll do that using these steps.

   <item title="Find SATC subfolder">
      <description>
         From earlier steps, you are now familiar with the Navigator. In the Navigator view, open the <b>SATC</b> sub-folder
      </description>

   <item title="Load ownship track">
      <description>
         From the SATC sub-folder, drag the <b>L1_OwnshipTrack.rep</b> file into the Debrief plot area. (Or, right click it, 
         and select "Open With > Debrief Plot Editor").

   <item title="Load ownship sensor data">
      <description>
         You should now see the Debrief editor, with a blue ownship track.<br/> Next, we will load the ownship sensor (sonar) data,
          by dragging in the <b>L1_OwnshipSensor.dsf</b> file. 
         Follow the Wizard steps to load the sensor data, give it a color, and indicate that Yes, you wish it to be visible.

   <item title="Check sensor data is visible">
      <description>
         <b>You did follow the wizard steps correctly, didn&apos;t you?</b> <br/>
         If you haven&apos;t got a bearing fan displayed on the plot, use the <b>Outline View</b> View to navigate to
          the <b>Plain</b> sensor within the <b>Ownship</b> track, and make it visible.
