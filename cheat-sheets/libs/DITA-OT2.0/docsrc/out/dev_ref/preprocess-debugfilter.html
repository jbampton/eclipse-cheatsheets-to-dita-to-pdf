<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The <samp class="ph codeph">debug-filter</samp> step processes all referenced DITA content and creates
copies in a temporary directory. As the DITA content is copied, filtering is performed, debugging
information is inserted, and table column names are adjusted. This step is implemented in
Java.</p>
<div class="section">     <p class="p">The following modifications are made to the DITA source:</p>
<ul class="ul"><li class="li">If a DITAVAL file is specified, the DITA source is filtered according to the entries in the
DITAVAL file.</li>
<li class="li">Debug information is inserted into each element using the @xtrf and @xtrc attributes. The values
of these attributes enable messages later in the build to reliably indicate the original source of
the error. For example, a message might trace back to the fifth &lt;ph&gt; element in a specific DITA
topic. Without these attributes, that count might no longer be available due to filtering and other
processing.</li>
<li class="li">The table column names are adjusted to use a common naming scheme. This is done only to simplify
later conref processing. For example, if a table row is pulled into another table, this ensures that
a reference to "column 5 properties" will continue to work in the fifth column of the new
table.</li>
