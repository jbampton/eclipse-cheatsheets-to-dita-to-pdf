<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The DITA-OT implements a multi-stage, map-driven architecture to process DITA content.
  Each stage in the process examines some or all of the content; some stages result in temporary
  files that are used by later steps, while others stages result in updated copies of the DITA
  content. Most of the processing takes place in a temporary working directory; the source files
  themselves are never modified.</p>
<p class="p">The DITA-OT is designed as a pipeline. Most of the pipeline is common to all output formats; it
   is known as the <dfn class="term">pre-processing stage</dfn>. In general, any DITA process begins with this
   common set of pre-processing routines. Once the pre-processing is completed, the pipeline
   diverges based on the requested output format. Some processing is still common to multiple output
   formats; for example, Eclipse Help and HTML Help both use the same routines to generate XHTML
   topics, after which the two pipelines branch to create different sets of navigation files.</p>
<p class="p">The following image illustrates how the pipeline works for some common output types: Docbook,
   PDF, Eclipse Help, XHTML, JavaHelp, and HTML Help.</p>
