<div class="body"><p class="shortdesc">The<span class="ph"><cite class="cite"> DITA Open Toolkit Project Management Guidelines</cite></span> are designed to
provide information about how the project is managed. These guidelines are geared to an audience
that needs information about how to participate in the development of the DITA-OT.</p>
<p class="p">The project is managed similarly to commercial software-development projects; it uses
requirements gathering, plan validation with stakeholders and contributors, scheduled activities,
tests, reviews, and builds. Quality is strongly emphasized.</p>

<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="../admin/DITA-OTProjectGoals.html">Goals and objectives of the DITA Open Toolkit</a></span><br />
The goal of the DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) is to provide a high-quality implementation
for production-level output of DITA content, built in a professionally-managed project environment
by vetted contributors, and tested thoroughly for each release.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="../admin/DevelopmentProcess.html">DITA Open Toolkit development process</a></span><br />
The DITA Open Toolkit (DITA-OT) development process is modeled after development
processes for other popular and successful open-source projects, most notably Eclipse.</li>
<li class="link ulchildlink"><span class="ulchildlinktext"><a href="../admin/HowToParticipate.html">How to participate in the DITA Open Toolkit</a></span><br />
Any individual or any organization can contribute to the
project; contributions must adhere to the existing toolkit license(s)
and should fit in with the general goals of the project. All major
contributors will get appropriate recognition in release announcements
and on the project home page.</li>
