<title>Map based linking (maplink)</title>
<shortdesc>This step collects links based on a map and moves those links into the referenced topics. The links are created based on hierarchy in the DITA map, the @collection-type attribute, and
    relationship tables. This step is implemented in XSLT and Java.</shortdesc>
<conbody>
<section><p>The <codeph>maplink</codeph> module runs an XSLT stylesheet that evaluates the map; it places all the generated links into a single file in memory. The module then runs a Java program that pushes
        the generated links into the applicable topics.</p></section>
