  <title>DITA to TocJS</title>
  <shortdesc>The <option>tocjs</option> transformation generates HTML5 output, a frameset, and a JavaScript-based table
    of contents with expandable and collapsible entries. The transformation was originally created by Shawn McKenzie as
    a plug-in and was added to the default distribution in DITA-OT release 1.5.4.</shortdesc>
