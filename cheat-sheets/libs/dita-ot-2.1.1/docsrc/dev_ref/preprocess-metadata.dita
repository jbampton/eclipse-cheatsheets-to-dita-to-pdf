  <title>Move metadata (move-meta-entries)</title>
  <shortdesc>The <codeph>move-meta-entries</codeph> step pushes metadata back and forth between maps and topics. For
    example, index entries and copyrights in the map are pushed into affected topics, so that the topics can be
    processed later in isolation while retaining all relevant metadata. This step is implemented in Java.</shortdesc>
