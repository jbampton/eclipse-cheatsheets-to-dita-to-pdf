      <description>
         This cheat sheet is going to work through creating a segment of target track from bearing data.  The target track is going to represent a period of straight-line motion, and can be interpreted as a Manual TMA Solution.  You should have open a tidy track and sensor data as produced in the previous cheat-sheet.  Feel free to close the Grid Editor window now that we&apos;re concentrating on the plot.

      <description>
         The capable analyst will be able to recognise a couple of periods of steady bearing rate that lend themselves to being the basis of TMA solutions.  The first one we&apos;re going to use is the first dozen or so sensor cuts.  We can see that after a period of about 10 unsteady cuts there&apos;s another steady period - we&apos;ll use that for a solution a little later.

      <description>
         We&apos;re going to change the color of the contacts to use for our first solution.  Double-click somewhere along the bearing line for the last data point in first period of steady bearing data - it will be highlighted in the Outline View.  By my (unqualified eye), the last data point is the one at <b>090722 044127</b>.  Click on that to select it.  Next scroll back up to the start of the sensor data, hold down the &lt;shift&gt; key and click on the first entry.  This period of sensor data is now selected.  Before creating a TMA segment based on it we&apos;re going to highlight it in a unique color. So, right-click anywhere on it, and select <b>Multiple items/Color/Orange</b>.

         Next, with the set of data still selected (or reselect it if you&apos;ve lost the selection) we&apos;re going to create a solution based upon it.  When we generate a TMA segment based on sensor data, Debrief creates a track segment of steady course/speed data points, with one data-point at the time of each sensor cut used to generate the segment.  Let&apos;s get on with it.

      <description>
          Now, right click on the selected sensor data and select <b>Generate TMA solution from selected cuts</b>. Once the TMA wizard opens, it will invite you to enter an initial range and bearing to the contact.  Enter 1 nautical mile (nm) for the solution, and leave the bearing unaltered (since it&apos;s using the bearing from our first sensor cut).  Then click <b>Next</b>.  The wizard will then invite you to enter an initial solution. Based on our understanding of the sensor fan and a complete guess, enter 220 for the course and 6 knots for the speed, then press <b>Finish</b>.  You will see a red track appear, labelled with <b>TMA_</b> and the time of the first cut used.   The solutions have times in their name to make it easier for you to manage them.

      <description>
         If you expand the new track in the <b>Outline View</b> you&apos;ll see the <b>Positions</b> child item.  Notice that the icon for this item shows a straight-line section of data with an associated (but tiny) compass rose).  The equivalent object for <b>Track:NONSUCH</b> shows a non straight-line set of positions.  Also, note that on the plot, the name of the TMA segment is shown in italics, to denote that it&apos;s not based on actual position recordings.

         title="Put the tracks on the tote">
      <description>
         To view residuals, we must indicate to Debrief which is the ownship and which is the target.  Debrief can hold many more than two tracks, so we must inform it which two tracks we want to compare with each other. So, in the Outline View, first select the <b>Track:NONSUCH</b> item, then click on the <b>1</b>  (primary) in the Outline View toolbar.  Next, click on the <b>Track_xxxx</b> item and select <b>2</b> (secondary) button in the Outline View toolbar.  If you switch to the <b>Track Tote</b> view (shortcut provided below) you&apos;ll now see it contains our primary and secondary tracks - and we&apos;ve successfully indicated who we want to view in the residuals plot.

         title="Drag the track segment">
      <description>
         You may now manipulate the track segment to minimise the bearing and frequency residuals. Start by clicking on <b>Drag Track Segment</b> on the Debrief toolbar. As you do, the <b>Bearing Residuals</b> view will be brought to the front.  You can expand this view by dragging it&apos;s sides, or to make it much larger you can pick it up by clicking and dragging the <b>Bearing Residuals</b> tab above it, and dragging it to another monitor.  
In this view are the 4 drag operation buttons, that control how you drag the track. The cursor hand will go green when over a valid hot-spot: either end of the track.  In some drag modes you can <b>translate</b> a track by clicking on the hotspot at its mid-point.  Have a go at selecting <b>Shear</b> mode and dragging the ends of the track - to optimise the bearing errors.

         Once you&apos;re happy with the first solution it&apos;s time to move on.   It would appear from the sensor data that the turn is represented by about 13 cuts before a further straight line section of data.
So, on the plot, now click on the first sensor cut of the second steady set of bearings - that cut will be highlighted in the <b>Outline View</b>. Now scroll down to the end of the data and shift-click the last sensor cut.  We&apos;ve now selected the cuts to be used for the second track segment.  Right click on one of the selected items and select <b>Multiple items/Color/Green</b>.  The cuts will turn green.  Now right-click again on the cuts and click on <b>Generate TMA solution from selected cuts</b>, and complete the wizard once again.

         Now, find the new solution in the Outline View and set it as the secondary track.   Once the new solution is marked as secondary you are able to start dragging/refining this solution.  Give it a go.
