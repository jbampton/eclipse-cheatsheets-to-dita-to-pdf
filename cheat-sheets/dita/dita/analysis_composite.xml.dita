After selecting an annotation from within that layer, click on the empty rectangle icon in the Outline View toolbar (next to the tick-in-rectangle). You should see the green tick disappear, together with the shape on the plot.  Show the shape again - but this time use the Outline View drop-down menu (at the right of the Outline View's toolbar).

               <cmd>Work with time periods</cmd>
               <info>There's one part of the Time Controller we haven't covered yet - that's the time period selector.  As its name suggests, this is used to select a period of time.  It doesn't work in quite the same way as the time-slider however, because typically nothing happens when you adjust it.  It is typically used to select a time-period to be used in a subsequent operation.  Here's an example: select a time period of 120700 to 121000.  Now select "Export calculated data to clipboard" from the Time Controller's drop-down menu.  Three hour's worth of calculated data have just been copied onto your system clipboard, ready to be pasted into Excel.  </info>

               <cmd>Control the visible time period</cmd>
               <info>Right, let's move on to another role of the Time Period selector.  The time-period selector is also used to select a time period when viewing time-variable graphs - but hey, let's not leap ahead of ourselves.  One last use for the time-period selector is more related to the current view.  If you select the 120600 to 120700 period, then depress the "Filter to period" icon on the Time Controller toolbar, when you move the time-sliders the plot is trimmed to that one hour period.  Holding down the shift-key makes the slider move in larger increments. Dragging the selected period whilst holding down the shift-key whilst in this mode effectively gives you the ability to jump through the exercise in one-hour blocks. <b>But</b>, so we don't lose our sample data, make sure you now extend the sliders out to their full range to reveal all of our training data.</info>

               <info>Note, for some time export operations you may find it difficult to select the <b>exact</b> time period you require. If this is the case, double-click on the start/finish time marker triangle, and the value will become editable in the Properties View</info>

               <info>The Time Controller's drop down menu contains a series of child menus.  In some of these you'll see an 'Edit properties' element. These let you control various aspects of temporal data analysis.  Once you've selected an item from the properties drop-down its attributes will become editable on the properties view (so open it, if it's not visible).

               <info>So, just one part of the time controller left to cover now, bookmarking a particular time or event.  Debrief NG lets you insert a bookmark attached to a particular DTG in the current plot.  Let's say you're analysing a particular exercise and want to record a couple of interactions.  In Normal view mode, move the time-slider to 121011 hrs - the point when RED first react to BLUE.  Now select "Add DTG as bookmark" from the Time-Controller's drop-down menu.  A dialog box will open inviting you to add a remark for that DTG.  Enter "First contact", then press "OK".   Now move to 121131 and enter a bookmark title "Plotlock start".  Hmm, where are those bookmarks?  Open the Bookmarks view from the "Window/Show view" menu - and you'll see your two bookmarks.  Double-click on either of them to move to that time.  Now save and close your plot.   Note that the bookmarks remain effective, and you can store as many bookmarks as you like, across as many analysis plots as you like.</info>

               <info>Right, select the period 120800 to 121100 using the time-period selector at the bottom of the Time Controller  (click help button above for more advice on the time controller).  Remember that holding down the shift-key makes the sliders move in one-hour jumps.</info>

               <info>Next we need to indicate what tracks we want to see information for.  In the bottom left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Outline View window.  If it isn't there, select "Outline View" from Debrief's Window/Show View menu.</info>

               <info>Well done, there you are.  Zoom in on the graph by dragging with the mouse, and view the whole dataset again by clicking on the graph's Fit to Window button.  Feel free to experiment with the other commands as well, or even configure the graph to use your preferred font &amp; titles.</info>

               <info>That's almost it for plotting graphs.  The only additional thing to add is to point out that it's not just tracks that can be the plotted. If you need to track proximity of multiple vehicles to a fixed point (such as a sensor), just insert a label annotation at that point and select the label in addition to the tracks - making sure you indicate that the label/sensor is the primary.</info>

            And that's all for using Debrief for analysis.  If you're from an organisation that conducts TMA analysis based on sensor data (or you've a general yearning to learn) why not go back to the <b>Welcome</b> page (using the <b>Restore Welcome</b> link at the top of this view and try the <b>Debrief support for single sided reconstruction</b> tutorial.
