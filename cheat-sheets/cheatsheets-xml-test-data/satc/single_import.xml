   <intro>
      <description>
         Debrief has a range of analysis and export capabilities that work on <b>Track</b> objects. 
         The current <b>Solution</b> isn&apos;t yet a track, so
         we have to import it.
      </description>
   </intro>
   <item
         title="Select scenario">
      <description>
         If you&apos;ve followed the instructions correctly then you will have a <b>Scenario</b> named <b>Single Leg</b> in your <b>Outline View</b> view.
         Select it.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Import as Composite Track">
      <description>
         The first way of importing, is to convert the current solution to a <b>Composite Track</b>. Just right-click on the scenario in the Outline View,
          and select <b>Convert to Composite Track (legs)</b>.
         <br/>Once you&apos;ve done that, you will see a new track appear on the plot (it&apos;s probably yellow). You will also see
          a new item in the <b>Outline View</b> - it will have the same name as the scenario, but it will be marked as a <b>Track</b>.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Rename to avoid confusion">
      <description>
         To prevent problems later on, we&apos;ll now rename the imported track. So, select the <b>Track:Single Leg_0</b> track in 
         the <b>Outline View</b>, then change its name to <b>Single Leg TMA</b> in the <b>Properties</b> view. 
         
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Tidy the plot">
      <description>
         Now, it would be all to easy for the plot to get confused here. So, use the <b>Outline View</b> to hide the red <b>SUBJECT</b> track.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Manually tune the TMA solution">
      <description>
         So, we should now just have the <b>OWNSHIP</b> and <b>Single Leg TMA</b> tracks visible.  Let&apos;s try adjusting the solution. We 
         do this just like we do for normal Single-Sided Reconstruction: click on the <b>Drag TMA Segment</b> arrow button in the Debrief toolbar.
         <br/>As you click it, you will see the <b>Bearing Residuals</b> view open.  Next, make the <b>OWNSHIP</b> track as the Primary track, and 
         the <b>Single Leg TMA</b> track as the secondary track (using the mini-toolbar above the <b>Outline View</b>). Now you can drag the yellow track
         and see the error residuals move.  
         <br/><br/><b>Note:</b> the <b>Absolute</b> values graph is easier to read in this instance if you select the <b>Plot absolute data on +/- 180 axes
         </b> button (it&apos;s in the <b>Bearing Residuals</b> toolbar, probably the second button along).
      </description>

   <item
      title="Import as standalone track">
      <description>
         Now, all that manual track fine-tuning is more suited to complex scenarios where you, the analyst remains unhappy with the SATC solution,
         culminating in the analyst merging the TMA solutions into a formal track.<br/>
         But, in this case, the raw SATC produced a perfectly acceptable solution. So, let&apos;s ditch the manual TMA track 
         (by right-clicking on <b>Single Leg TMA</b> and selecting 
         <b>Delete Single Leg TMA</b>. Instead let&apos;s just import our original TMA solution by right-clicking on the <b>Single Leg</b> 
         scenario, and selecting <b>Convert to Standalone Track</b>.
         <br/><br/>You will now see the track has appeared in the <b>Outline View</b> as <b>Track:Single Leg</b>.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item
      title="Mark our homework">
      <description>
         At this point we happen to have our imported TMA Solution (<b>Track:Single Leg_0</b>), and the Truth Track (<b>Track:SUBJECT</b>)
         both loaded in Debrief.  We can 
         now use the application to calculate the distance between the two tracks.
         <br/><br/>
         Select <b>Track:Single Leg_TMA</b> and <b>Track:Subject</b> in the Outline View (use &lt;ctrl&gt; to multi-select).  
         Now, right click on either of them, and select <b>View XY Plot</b>.          
         <br/><br/>
         From the dialog that opens, select <b>Range</b> as the attribute to view, then select <b>Track:Subject</b> as the primary track.
         <br/><br/>
         You will see a graph open. This will show that the start of the track has an error of around 140 yds, reducing to 60 near the end.  This seems
         quite good considering the target range from 8000 to 3000 yards from ownship.
