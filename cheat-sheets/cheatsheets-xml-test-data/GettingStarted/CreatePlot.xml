    <description>
       Debrief will store the new plot in one of your existing folders.  If your navigator contains links to both shared training data and personal data folders, it&apos;s probably best to create this plot in your personal data folder.

		<description>In the Navigator view, right-click on the parent folder for your new plot and select <b>New</b>/<b>Debrief Plot</b> and the Wizard will open.  Once the wizard opens, the first step is to confirm where you would like the plot to be stored (it&apos;s <b>Container</b>). If you&apos;re not happy with the specified location click on <b>Browse</b> button and select the top-level folder of your data directories.  Also provide a filename.
Using the wizard, follow the series of tabs to indicate what information you&apos;d like shown in the background of the plot, clicking Finish to complete.  Some of the steps will not advance until all of the necessary fields have been filled.

       Once the Wizard has closed, the plot you&apos;ve created can be found in the folder you specified.
