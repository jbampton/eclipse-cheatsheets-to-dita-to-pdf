	<intro>
		<description>So, you've found your data, loaded it into Debrief, and now you want to make
			some changes to it. This cheat-sheet will give you some pointers.</description>
	</intro>
	<item title="Check you have some data" href="/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cnav.htm">
		<description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window. If
			it isn't there, select "Navigator" from Debrief's Window/Show View menu. Also check you
			have our sample data-files - it they're not there, find how to load them from the
			"Loading sample data" cheat-sheet.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Open the sample plot-file">
		<description>If it&apos;s not already open, double-click on &apos;sample.xml&apos; in the
			Navigator window, and the sample plot will open.</description>
	</item>
	<item href="/org.mwc.debrief.help/html/legacy/moving_around.html" title="Fit to window">
		<description>You can also experiment with zooming in and out.  Click the zoom out
			button once to zoom out, or put plot into <b>Zoom In</b> mode by clicking on the Zoom In
			button. Now, when you drag an area, the map will zoom in on that viewport.<br/>
			Lastly, to make sure all of the data is visible, click on the &quot;Fit-to-Window&quot;
			toolbar button. Read more about the toolbar buttons by clicking on the help-link to the
			right of this text.  </description>
	</item>
	<item title="View the data in tree form">
		<description> In addition to viewing your data on the 2D plot, the <b>Outline View</b>
			displays it in tree form. Switch to the <b>Outline View</b> view to see the data. 
			If the Outline View isn't open already, you can open it via the <b>Window/Show View</b> menu.
			You&apos;ll see the two tracks there, together with other layers that contain <b>Chart
				Features</b> (such as the <b>Grid</b> and <b>Scale</b>), and the <b>Misc</b> layer
			that contains graphical annotations. </description>
	</item>
	<item title="Make sure the properties window is open"
		href="/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cpropview.htm">
		<description>The properties window is normally at the bottom left of Debrief. If it's there
			but not at the top of the 'stack', click on its title to reveal it. If you can't find
			it, select "Properties" from the 'Window/Show View" drop-down list.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Select an item">
		<description>Now double-click on one of the corners of the green rectangle near the centre
			of the track plot. You&apos;ll now see its editable attributes appear on the properties
			window. Cool. You&apos;ll see that the attributes are grouped for ease of use, and some
			must be expanded (those for location &amp; time).</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Make a change">
		<description>Now have a go at changing the rectangle's label color. Click once on the green
			rectangle next to 'LabelColor'. A button containing three dots will appear. Click on
			this to open the color editor. Click on the red rectangle and then the 'OK' button. The
			dialog will close, the label color property will be updated, and the plot will redraw.
			Well done.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Undo the change">
		<description>Oops, it appears we shouldn&apos;t have changed the label color, it
			doesn&apos;t meet NATO MilStd 12332 Sub-para 14g (2002 version). To undo a change, first
			click on the tab at the top of the <b>sample.xml</b> plot (to tell Debrief which plot
			we&apos;re undoing). Now click on the Edit menu, and select Undo (it&apos;s the first
			item). The color of the label will now change back. Look on the Edit menu again, and
			you&apos;ll see there&apos;s now a &quot;Redo&quot; command available - just in case
			you&apos;re undecided about your adherence to sub-para 14g. Note, it&apos;s not just
			edits that are undo-able, lots of operations can be undone, just have a look on the Edit
			menu whenever you feel the need to step-back. If you think something isn&apos;t on there
			but it should be, just ask... <b>But it did
				not undo!</b>. The Undo button applies to whichever is the active Debrief view. So,
			to undo a change to the plot, first need to select the plot (or the tab containing hte
			plot name), then press undo.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Edit a position">
		<description>To select a position within a track, just double-click on it - its editable
			attributes will appear in the properties window. You can now change the symbol or label
			(<b>LabelShowing</b> or <b>SymbolShowing</b>, 
			visibility, or the color (<b>Color</b>) that position will be plotted in. Note: you may have to scroll up &amp; down the 
			<b>Properties Window</b> to see all of the properties.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Edit a whole track">
		<description>Aaah, but how do you edit a track? Easy, just use the Outline View to select
			it rather than clicking on the plot. Open the Outline View (or select Outline View
			from the Window/Show View drop-down menu). In the Outline View click once on the name
			of a track, and the whole track's properties will be editable in the Properties View.
			The Outline View is also useful for selecting non-geographic entities (such as a grid,
			scale, or background data-set) to be edited.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Re-arrange the views">
		<description>Now, are you finding it a bit of pain switching between the Outline View and
			Properties views? Using your mouse, just click and drag the Properties panel upwards -
			so it&apos;s on top of the view vertically above it. You can now see the Outline View
			and Properties windows at once.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Edit directly from the plot itself">
		<description>For some attributes, you don't even need to use the Properties View. Just
			right-click on an item on your plot. The popup menu shows a series of options and
			commands. A drop-down menu is shown next to the current item's name. From this drop-down
			menu you'll be able to edit all of the item's true/false or 'select one from many'
			attributes. Note, if you click on a vehicle position, a drop-down is shown for the
			parent track as well as the position itself. Also note, that the right-click menu is
			shown if you click on an item from the Outline View.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Don't forget to save">
		<description>Now that you've invested all that effort in your plot, don't forget to save it.
			Just click on the floppy-disk icon on the main toolbar. If the data you're looking is
			actually an REP file, you will be invited to save the file in Debrief's XML plot-file
			format - since REPs can't store formatting data.</description>
