         Let&apos;s understand the data we&apos;ve got, before we start playing with it

      <description>         
         When you view the tutoral plot you will see an ownship track.  Use the Debrief <b>Time Controller</b> and <b>Track Tote</b> to 
         familiarise yourself with the general motion of the <b>OWNSHIP</b> track.  You&apos;ll see that it starts in the 
         North-East of the area, then travels quite slowly at 2.5 knots, with two straight legs.

      <description>         
         The identification of straight legs is pivotal to the SATC process, since they greatly constrain
         the possible solution combinations.
         <br/>
         Just as when conducting Manual TMA generation using Debrief, the best practice for this process is to color the sensor cuts according
         to the leg they&apos;re contained in.  If you examine the Ownship sensor data, you&apos;ll see 
         that the first and second legs have been coloured in green and purple, respectively. Between each leg, a
         few cuts have been left red, to provide time for the target to make alterations.

         title="Mark the final target leg">
      <description>         
         Whilst the first two target legs have been coloured, the last one hasn&apos;t. Let&apos;s do it now. 
         <br/><br/>
         Expand the sensor data
         in the Outline View, and select the sensor cuts from <b>100112 134230</b> until the end of the
         dataset, at <b>100112 140000</b>.  Now use the <b>Properties</b> view to change the color of these cuts to <b>Yellow</b> 
         (or obviously you could right-click and select Color > Yellow).

      title="Create the scenario">
      <description>
         The most significant block of information in generating a solution is the bearing data.  So, the 
         first step is to provide the bearing data.  We are going to use all of the Ownship sensor data for this
         solution, so right-click on the <b>Sensor:Plain (145 items)</b> sensor, and select <b>Semi Auto TMA</b> / 
         <b>Create new scenario from these cuts</b>.
         <br/>As with the previous tutorial, you will see the new scenario (called <b>121200.00</b> appear in the Outline View, and the 
         <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view will open. 
         <br/>You will also see that the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view contains just the one contribution.

   <item
      title="Rename the scenario">
      <description>         
         To make it easier to navigate the data, please use the <b>Properties</b> view to rename 
         the new scenario to <b>Tutorial Scenario</b>
      </description>

   <item
      title="Try to generate a solution">
      <description>         
         Hey, why not try to generate a solution.  Just click on <b>Calculate Solution</b> at the top of the
         <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view.  You will see Debrief do a couple of seconds of processing, and then stop.
         This is because Debrief doesn&apos;t have enough information to generate a solution.  It needs to know
         one or more straight legs.
