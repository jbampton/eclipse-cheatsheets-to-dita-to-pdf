   <intro>
      <description>
         After the bearing measurements, knowledge of the straight legs is the most valuable set of information for SATC.
      </description>
   </intro>
   <item
      title="Mark first leg">
      <description>         
         Ok, let&apos;s mark the first leg. In the <b>Outline View</b>, expand the Ownship sensor data, and select all of the
         <b>Green</b> cuts.  Now, right-click on them, and select <b>Semi Auto TMA</b> / <b>Add to Tutorial Scenario</b> / 
         <b>Straight leg for period covered by [sensor cuts]</b>. When asked, give it the name <b>First Leg</b>.
         <br/><br/><b>Note:</b> selecting the cuts and "giving" them to the solution isn&apos;t actually adding
         the cuts - the solution knows about the cuts already.  We&apos;re justing using the block of cuts
          as a convenient way of specifying the start and end times for the leg.

      title="Try to generate a solution (again)">
      <description>         
         Ok, now we should be able to generate a solution.  Again, click on <b>Calculate Solution</b> at the top of the
         <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view.  You will see Debrief do a couple of seconds of processing, you&apos;ll see
         a line graph appearing in the <b>Performance</b> area of the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view, and a green
         line will appear on the plot.  Zooming in on the plot shows us that the single leg is 9.2 kts, at 319 degrees.  If we 
         zoom out again, we can see that, Yes, this could be a solution that fits in the data.
         <br/><b>Note:</b> the use of randomisation in the SATC process means that your calculated speeds may well be different
         to mine. Don&apos;t worry, this is intended.

      title="Mark second leg">
      <description>         
         Now, we&apos;ll mark the second leg. In the <b>Outline View</b>, expand the Ownship sensor data, and select all of the
         <b>Purple</b> cuts.  Now, right-click on them, and select <b>Semi Auto TMA</b> / <b>Add to Tutorial Scenario</b> / 
         <b>Straight leg for period covered by [sensor cuts]</b>. When asked, give it the name <b>Second Leg</b>.
         <br/>The solution on the plot will disappear, since the new data means that it&apos;s probably incorrect.
         <br/>To see the effect of the new leg, click again on the <b>Calculate Solution</b> button.
      </description>

   <item
      title="Generate updated solution">
      <description>         
         Now generate a new solution.  You&apos;ll see two legs present, the first with 12.1 knots, and the second with 14.1 knots.
         Clearly SATC has changed it&apos;s optimal solution for the first leg to a faster one that is more compliant with the data 
         in the second leg.

   <item
      title="Mark third leg">
      <description>         
         Ok, now let&apos;s mark the third leg using the <b>Yellow</b> cuts, and re-generate the solution again.  The solution
         produced has a speed of 4.8 knots.
         <br/>So, now we have a three-leg solution that is compliant with our sensor data, and our straight leg forecasts.
         <br/>We can take a step to verify this by switching on the location constraints.  First, select the <b>Tutorial Scenario</b>
          in the <b>Outline View</b>. Then, in the <b>Properties</b> window, switch on <b>ShowLocationConstraints</b>. You&apos;ll see
         lots and lots of clutter on the plot. Also switch on <b>OnlyPlotLegEnds</b>.  This shows the calculated location 
         constraints at the start and end of each leg.  We can see that yes, the solution is compliant with them.

   <item
      title="Give speed constraint">
      <description>         
         So, we&apos;ve got a solution.  But, I think it can be improved.  Let&apos;s try to give the target a consistent speed. We&apos;re
         going to give a speed constraint to the whole period of the engagement. We could have done this by right-clicking on the whole <b>Sensor:Plain</b>
         object, but an alternate way of doing this is to right-click on our <b>Tutorial Scenario</b> object in the <b>Outline View</b>,  
         and selecting <b>Add Speed Forecast for period covered by [Tutorial Scenario]</b>.  A wizard will open, name the contribution
         as <b>Overall Speed</b>. You will see this new constraint displayed in the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view - with a default set
         of hard constraints shown: zero to forty knots.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Adjust speed constraint">
      <description>
         Ok, let&apos;s generate a new solution.  A constraint of 0-40 knots isn&apos;t much of a constraint at all, so it has little effect.  So,
         expand the <b>Speed Constraint - overall speed</b> item in the <b>Maintain Contributions</b> view. Now reduce the maximum speed from 
         40 knots down to 15 knots.  If you still have the Location constraints visible, you will see them adjust to repesent the new constraint.
         <br/>This is because the vessel can&apos;t travel as far in each leg.  Also, increase the minimum speed to 8 knots.  Re-generate the solution
         and see what you think.  
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Provide speed estimate">
      <description>
         Lastly, let&apos;s try an estimate.  The estimate will make the algorithm favour solutions near that value, though
         it will still consider solutions that are still within the min/max hard constraints.  Try an estimate of 9 knots, and re-generate
         the solution.  I get a solution with speeds of 9, 13, and 9 knots.  But, I can see that if the overall solution was moved nearer to ownship,
         I may be able to achieve a consistent speed. So, now reduce the max speed to 10 knots, and re-generate the solution.  
         <br/>This gives me legs that are 9.6, 8.9 and 9.0 knots.  I may then choose to drag in the min/max sliders to really force
         the solution onto a particular speed, but I&apos;m ok with this answer.
      </description>

   <item title="Verify solution">
      <description>
         Ok, now how good is that solution?  In the <b>Outline View</b>, make the <b>SUBJECT</b> track visible.  You should see
         that the generated solution is very close to the truth track, even with this low bearing rate data.  If you wish to 
         verify the calculated solution against the truth track, you can view the XY Range plot (again) and see the separation
         between the two tracks.
