# eclipse-cheatsheets-to-dita-to-pdf

I worked on https://github.com/debrief/debrief and I was given permission to extract the part of the project I worked on.

Basically this code takes a set of Eclipse cheat sheets and transforms them to PDF.

It's a two step process first the Dita XML is created from the ecliplse cheat sheets and then you use Dita-OT to create the PDF from the created dita files.
