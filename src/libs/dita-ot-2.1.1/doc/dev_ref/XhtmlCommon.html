  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">After the pre-processing operation runs, HTML-based builds each run a common series of Ant targets to
    generate HTML file. Navigation may be created before or after this set of common routines.</p>

    <div class="p">After the pre-processing is completed, the following targets are run for all of the HTML-based builds:<ul class="ul">
        <li class="li">If the <span class="keyword parmname">arg.css</span> parameter is passed to the build to add a CSS file, the
            <samp class="ph codeph">copy-css</samp> target copies the CSS file from its source location to the relative location in
          the output directory.</li>

        <li class="li">If a DITAVAL file is used, the <samp class="ph codeph">copy-revflag</samp> target copies the default start- and
          end-revision flags into the output directory.</li>

        <li class="li">The DITA topics are converted to HTML files. Unless the @chunk attribute was specified, each DITA topic in
          the temporary directory now corresponds to one HTML file. The<samp class="ph codeph">dita.inner.topics.xhtml</samp> target
          is used to process documents that are in the map directory (or subdirectories of the map directory). The
            <samp class="ph codeph">dita.outer.topics.xhtml</samp> target is used to process documents that are outside of the scope
          of the map, and thus might end up outside of the designated output directory. Various DITA-OT parameters
          control how documents processed by the <samp class="ph codeph">dita.outer.topics.xhtml</samp> target are handled.</li>

      </ul>
