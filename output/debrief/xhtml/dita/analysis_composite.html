               <div class="itemgroup info">There's one part of the Time Controller we haven't covered yet - that's the time period selector.  As its name suggests, this is used to select a period of time.  It doesn't work in quite the same way as the time-slider however, because typically nothing happens when you adjust it.  It is typically used to select a time-period to be used in a subsequent operation.  Here's an example: select a time period of 120700 to 121000.  Now select "Export calculated data to clipboard" from the Time Controller's drop-down menu.  Three hour's worth of calculated data have just been copied onto your system clipboard, ready to be pasted into Excel.  </div>

               <div class="itemgroup info">Right, let's move on to another role of the Time Period selector.  The time-period selector is also used to select a time period when viewing time-variable graphs - but hey, let's not leap ahead of ourselves.  One last use for the time-period selector is more related to the current view.  If you select the 120600 to 120700 period, then depress the "Filter to period" icon on the Time Controller toolbar, when you move the time-sliders the plot is trimmed to that one hour period.  Holding down the shift-key makes the slider move in larger increments. Dragging the selected period whilst holding down the shift-key whilst in this mode effectively gives you the ability to jump through the exercise in one-hour blocks. <strong class="ph b">But</strong>, so we don't lose our sample data, make sure you now extend the sliders out to their full range to reveal all of our training data.</div>

In Normal view mode, move the time-slider to 121011 hrs - the point when RED first react to BLUE.  Now select "Add DTG as bookmark" from the Time-Controller's drop-down menu.  A dialog box will open inviting you to add a remark for that DTG.  Enter "First contact", then press "OK".   Now move to 121131 and enter a bookmark title "Plotlock start".  Hmm, where are those bookmarks?  Open the Bookmarks view from the "Window/Show view" menu - and you'll see your two bookmarks.  Double-click on either of them to move to that time.

      <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">Debrief is capable of producing analysis products beyond the traditional graphical track plots.  After all, it's got the data hasn't it?  The most obvious derived products are the analysis plots - graphs showing time versus either a recorded data value or a calculation based on a specific set of data-values.  Why not learn more...</p>

If you need to track proximity of multiple vehicles to a fixed point (such as a sensor), just insert a label annotation at that point and select the label in addition to the tracks - making sure you indicate that the label/sensor is the primary.</div>
