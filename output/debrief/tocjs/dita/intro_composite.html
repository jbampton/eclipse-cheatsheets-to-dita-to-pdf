      <h2 class="title topictitle2">Defining your workspace</h2>

      <p class="shortdesc">
            In comparison with prior versions of Debrief, Debrief NG introduces the concept of a Workspace - a central repository for your assorted analysis-related documents.  Within this workspace your work is grouped into individual projects: thus you can quickly switch between concurrent analysis tasks.  Debrief's provision of projects allows you to quickly drag and drop Debrief data-files and plots.

The Replay file format is a very simple, column oriented text format that's ideal for passing around track data.  But, it isn't suited to storing formatting data or user preferences.  This is where the Debrief xml file type comes in.  Whilst it's still a textual file format, it has a rich structure that allows it to store a wide range of data types and subjects.  Thus a typical flow for data is that it enters Debrief in REP format, the analyst creates a custom plot based on this data, and then stores the plot as an XML file.
