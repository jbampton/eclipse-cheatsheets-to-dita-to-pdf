            <strong class="ph b">Introduction</strong>
Let's start off with an easy scenario. We're going to work on an engagement where there is just a single leg of target data.

         <h3 class="title topictitle3">Finding the sample data</h3>

         <p class="shortdesc">
               There are two ways to load the sample data. We're probably going to end up modifying the sample data, 
               so you shouldn't
               do that if you're working on a set of sample data that's shared with other users  (since you 
               would be modifying the <strong class="ph b">master</strong> copy of the data). Start off by considering if your Debrief installation folder
               is on your local machine, or on a Network Shared Folder.
            </p>

            <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">Debrief NG stores it's data in a local folder called a Project. While
			these are frequently created afresh to store new analysis data, it's also possible
			to denote your existing data directories as sub-folders (via links). This tutorial leads
			you through generating links to your existing data folders. If you've installed
			Debrief in the past, chances are you still have a Debrief installation folder (in
			C:\Program Files\Debrief 2003). If you do still have this folder, you can usefully link
			it in within this tutorial to provide some sample data. If you don't have an
			existing Debrief installation, then add the folder called <strong class="ph b">sample_data</strong> located in
			the top-level folder of your Debrief NG installation (typically in c:\DebriefNG under MS
			Windows if you have Debrief installed locally, or in the Debrief\DebriefNG folder

			network drive).</p>

         Just as when conducting Manual TMA generation using Debrief, the best practice for this process is to color the sensor cuts according
         to the leg they're contained in.  If you examine the Ownship sensor data, you'll see 
         that the first and second legs have been coloured in green and purple, respectively. Between each leg, a
         few cuts have been left red, to provide time for the target to make alterations.

         Clearly SATC has changed it's optimal solution for the first leg to a faster one that is more compliant with the data 
         in the second leg.

         Ok, now let's mark the third leg using the <strong class="ph b">Yellow</strong> cuts, and re-generate the solution again.  The solution
         produced has a speed of 4.8 knots.
         <span class="ph"></span>So, now we have a three-leg solution that is compliant with our sensor data, and our straight leg forecasts.
         <span class="ph"></span>We can take a step to verify this by switching on the location constraints.  First, select the <strong class="ph b">Tutorial Scenario</strong>
          in the <strong class="ph b">Outline View</strong>. Then, in the <strong class="ph b">Properties</strong> window, switch on <strong class="ph b">ShowLocationConstraints</strong>. You'll see
         lots and lots of clutter on the plot. Also switch on <strong class="ph b">OnlyPlotLegEnds</strong>.  This shows the calculated location 
         constraints at the start and end of each leg.  We can see that yes, the solution is compliant with them.

                  <div class="itemgroup info">         
         So, we've got a solution.  But, I think it can be improved.  Let's try to give the target a consistent speed. We're
         going to give a speed constraint to the whole period of the engagement. We could have done this by right-clicking on the whole <strong class="ph b">Sensor:Plain</strong>
         object, but an alternate way of doing this is to right-click on our <strong class="ph b">Tutorial Scenario</strong> object in the <strong class="ph b">Outline View</strong>,  
         and selecting <strong class="ph b">Add Speed Forecast for period covered by [Tutorial Scenario]</strong>.  A wizard will open, name the contribution
         as <strong class="ph b">Overall Speed</strong>. You will see this new constraint displayed in the <strong class="ph b">Maintain Contributions</strong> view - with a default set
         of hard constraints shown: zero to forty knots.

                  <span class="ph cmd">Adjust speed constraint</span>
                  <div class="itemgroup info">
         Ok, let's generate a new solution.  A constraint of 0-40 knots isn't much of a constraint at all, so it has little effect.  So,
         expand the <strong class="ph b">Speed Constraint - overall speed</strong> item in the <strong class="ph b">Maintain Contributions</strong> view. Now reduce the maximum speed from 
         40 knots down to 15 knots.  If you still have the Location constraints visible, you will see them adjust to repesent the new constraint.
         <span class="ph"></span>This is because the vessel can't travel as far in each leg.  Also, increase the minimum speed to 8 knots.  Re-generate the solution
         and see what you think.

                  <div class="itemgroup info">
         Lastly, let's try an estimate.  The estimate will make the algorithm favour solutions near that value, though
         it will still consider solutions that are still within the min/max hard constraints.  Try an estimate of 9 knots, and re-generate
         the solution.  I get a solution with speeds of 9, 13, and 9 knots.  But, I can see that if the overall solution was moved nearer to ownship,
         I may be able to achieve a consistent speed. So, now reduce the max speed to 10 knots, and re-generate the solution.  
         <span class="ph"></span>This gives me legs that are 9.6, 8.9 and 9.0 knots.  I may then choose to drag in the min/max sliders to really force
         the solution onto a particular speed, but I'm ok with this answer.

         verify the calculated solution against the truth track, you can view the XY Range plot (again) and see the separation
         between the two tracks.
