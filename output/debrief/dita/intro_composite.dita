   <title>Getting started with Debrief NG</title>
   <shortdesc>
         This series of cheatsheets will guide you through creating your Debrief working environment, customising it according to your preferred file locations, and loading some analysis data.  If you wish, you can widen this 'Welcome' panel to make the tutorials easier to read.  You may also find it easier to work through these cheat-sheets if you make the bottom section of this pane taller by dragging the central 'grab' bar vertically upwards

      <title>Defining your workspace</title>
      <shortdesc>
            In comparison with prior versions of Debrief, Debrief NG introduces the concept of a Workspace - a central repository for your assorted analysis-related documents.  Within this workspace your work is grouped into individual projects: thus you can quickly switch between concurrent analysis tasks.  Debrief's provision of projects allows you to quickly drag and drop Debrief data-files and plots.

      <task id="d4e16">
         <title>Generating a project for your data</title>
         <shortdesc>Debrief NG stores it's data in a local folder called a Project. It's into this
         folder that you place analysis files and links to existing data folders elsewhere on your
         machine/network. This tutorial will lead you through creating a new, blank project.

         the conventional 2D Debrief plot. They can be closed by clicking on the <b>X</b> icon on
         their name tab. They can also be dragged around, both within Debrief (to put them, for
         example on the opposite side of the application), or out of Debrief into a separate window.
         When you close Debrief, it remembers the views that were previously open. </info>

The Replay file format is a very simple, column oriented text format that's ideal for passing around track data.  But, it isn't suited to storing formatting data or user preferences.  This is where the Debrief xml file type comes in.  Whilst it's still a textual file format, it has a rich structure that allows it to store a wide range of data types and subjects.  Thus a typical flow for data is that it enters Debrief in REP format, the analyst creates a custom plot based on this data, and then stores the plot as an XML file.

			doesn't meet NATO MilStd 12332 Sub-para 14g (2002 version). To undo a change, first
			click on the tab at the top of the <b>sample.xml</b> plot (to tell Debrief which plot
			we're undoing). Now click on the Edit menu, and select Undo (it's the first
			item). The color of the label will now change back. Look on the Edit menu again, and
			you'll see there's now a "Redo" command available - just in case
			you're undecided about your adherence to sub-para 14g. Note, it's not just
			edits that are undo-able, lots of operations can be undone, just have a look on the Edit
			menu whenever you feel the need to step-back. If you think something isn't on there
			but it should be, just ask... <b>But it did
				not undo!</b>. The Undo button applies to whichever is the active Debrief view. So,
			to undo a change to the plot, first need to select the plot (or the tab containing hte
			plot name), then press undo.</info>
