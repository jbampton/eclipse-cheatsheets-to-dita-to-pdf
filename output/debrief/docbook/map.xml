            In comparison with prior versions of Debrief, Debrief NG introduces the concept of a Workspace - a central repository for your assorted analysis-related documents.  Within this workspace your work is grouped into individual projects: thus you can quickly switch between concurrent analysis tasks.  Debrief's provision of projects allows you to quickly drag and drop Debrief data-files and plots.

The Replay file format is a very simple, column oriented text format that's ideal for passing around track data.  But, it isn't suited to storing formatting data or user preferences.  This is where the Debrief xml file type comes in.  Whilst it's still a textual file format, it has a rich structure that allows it to store a wide range of data types and subjects.  Thus a typical flow for data is that it enters Debrief in REP format, the analyst creates a custom plot based on this data, and then stores the plot as an XML file.

It doesn't work in quite the same way as the time-slider however, because typically nothing happens when you adjust it.  It is typically used to select a time-period to be used in a subsequent operation.  Here's an example: select a time period of 120700 to 121000.  Now select "Export calculated data to clipboard" from the Time Controller's drop-down menu.

               <para remap="#PCDATA">Right, let's move on to another role of the Time Period selector.  The time-period selector is also used to select a time period when viewing time-variable graphs - but hey, let's not leap ahead of ourselves.  One last use for the time-period selector is more related to the current view.  If you select the 120600 to 120700 period, then depress the "Filter to period" icon on the Time Controller toolbar, when you move the time-sliders the plot is trimmed to that one hour period.  Holding down the shift-key makes the slider move in larger increments. Dragging the selected period whilst holding down the shift-key whilst in this mode effectively gives you the ability to jump through the exercise in one-hour blocks. <emphasis role="bold" id="bd780e425" remap="b">But</emphasis>, so we don't lose our sample data, make sure you now extend the sliders out to their full range to reveal all of our training data.</para>

         If you zoom out to look at all the frequency data you'll see that whilst the frequency data seems fairly constant near the top of the dataset (49.99), there are occasional instances where the data value seems too low (when viewed in the context of a steady ownship track).  We're going to fix an errant data point by dragging it.  Firstly, zoom in on the data around the time 05:20.  You'll see that the data-point at 05:19:11 is quite a lot lower than its neighbours.  Move it by clicking inside the square data point and dragging the symbol so that it's in line with it's neighbours. Note that if the neighbours were in a steady drift you could align by eye where you drop the data point to align with the more tidily.

Fairly near the top of the bearing data you will see three steps in the data, around the period 05:10 to 05:20.  Zoom in on these three steps.  It appears that the last smooth data point before the steps is at 05:10:44, and the first after the steps is at 05:21:30.  We're going to interpolate the data points between these two values, so first we must tell Debrief which are the points we intend keeping.

         Note that we only selected a single point at each end of the poor data.  There are two other, more advanced ways of doing the interpolation.  If we had selected multiple points at the ends of the dodgy data then Debrief would have made the interpolated values fit through a cubic spline that passed through the selected points.  Similarly, if we had selected one or more points in the middle of the dodgy data (in addition to point(s) at the ends) then Debrief would have fitted a curve through the end and mid points of the dataset.

         We can move on now that we've tidied the sensor data.  As you'll see, the sensor data is ambiguous, as produced by a towed array.  Currently Debrief is plotting the sensor cuts against the attack datum of the platform, but we need to apply an offset for this sensor (-451m in this case).

Anyway, ignore the shared values and enter -451 in this field, click on the Plot, and you'll see the bearings jump to reflect the change. To see where the current array centre is, switch on <emphasis role="bold" id="bd1534e282" remap="b">Plot Array Centre</emphasis> from the properties for the parent track - you'll see a cross appear astern of the current submarine location.

         that the first and second legs have been coloured in green and purple, respectively. Between each leg, a
         few cuts have been left red, to provide time for the target to make alterations.

         So, we've got a solution.  But, I think it can be improved.  Let's try to give the target a consistent speed. We're

         object, but an alternate way of doing this is to right-click on our <emphasis role="bold" id="bd2225e657" remap="b">Tutorial Scenario</emphasis> object in the <emphasis role="bold" id="bd2225e660" remap="b">Outline View</emphasis>,  
         and selecting <emphasis role="bold" id="bd2225e663" remap="b">Add Speed Forecast for period covered by [Tutorial Scenario]</emphasis>.  A wizard will open, name the contribution
         as <emphasis role="bold" id="bd2225e666" remap="b">Overall Speed</emphasis>. You will see this new constraint displayed in the <emphasis role="bold" id="bd2225e670" remap="b">Maintain Contributions</emphasis> view - with a default set

         Ok, let's generate a new solution.  A constraint of 0-40 knots isn't much of a constraint at all, so it has little effect.  So,
         expand the <emphasis role="bold" id="bd2225e684" remap="b">Speed Constraint - overall speed</emphasis> item in the <emphasis role="bold" id="bd2225e687" remap="b">Maintain Contributions</emphasis> view. Now reduce the maximum speed from 
         40 knots down to 15 knots.  If you still have the Location constraints visible, you will see them adjust to repesent the new constraint.
         <phrase id="phrsd2225e690" remap="ph"/>This is because the vessel can't travel as far in each leg.  Also, increase the minimum speed to 8 knots.  Re-generate the solution

         Lastly, let's try an estimate.  The estimate will make the algorithm favour solutions near that value, though
         it will still consider solutions that are still within the min/max hard constraints.  Try an estimate of 9 knots, and re-generate
         the solution.  I get a solution with speeds of 9, 13, and 9 knots.  But, I can see that if the overall solution was moved nearer to ownship,
         I may be able to achieve a consistent speed. So, now reduce the max speed to 10 knots, and re-generate the solution.  
         <phrase id="phrsd2225e703" remap="ph"/>This gives me legs that are 9.6, 8.9 and 9.0 knots.  I may then choose to drag in the min/max sliders to really force
